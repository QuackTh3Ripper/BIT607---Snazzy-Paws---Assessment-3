I noticed that when testing the assignment there was a mistake within the roster,
after doing some trouble shooting, may not be able to the fix website but wanted to show
that the issue has been addressed and 

the current login credentials should be changed to: 

if(CREDENTIALS[u] && CREDENTIALS[u] === p) {
  sessionStorage.setItem('sp_logged_in','true');
  sessionStorage.setItem('sp_user', u);
  const target = sessionStorage.getItem('sp_after_login') || 'roster.html';
  sessionStorage.removeItem('sp_after_login');
  window.location.replace(target);
} else {
  showError();
}
